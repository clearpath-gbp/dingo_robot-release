ros-noetic-dingo-bringup (0.1.5-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Add "_secondary" suffix to secondary laser node
    "RLException: roslaunch file contains multiple nodes named [/hokuyo]." is thrown if primary and secondary lasers are both enabled. This is because both envars launch an instance of the urg_node with the same name "hokuyo". Adding a "_secondary" suffix to the secondary laser node resolves this issue.
